# üì¶ Arduino Humidity Monitor Using Adafruit Si7021, LCD, and Arduino Uno R4 WiFi

> *This project uses the Arduino paired with the Adafruit Si7021 humidity and temperature sensor to track the humidity level of different environments (terrarium or indoor). It alerts users when humidity shifts out of the ideal range through an LCD display, buzzer alerts, and LED indicators (red, yellow, and green).*

## üß© About

### What problem does this solve?
For those interested in building their own terrarium or monitoring the humidity of their home, this project provides an effective solution. Maintaining proper humidity levels is critical for:

- **Terrarium environments:** Keeping plants and small creatures in optimal conditions
- **Indoor spaces:** Preventing mold growth while maintaining comfortable living conditions

This monitor eliminates guesswork by providing real-time feedback and alerts when humidity levels drift outside optimal ranges.

### How it works
The system monitors humidity using the Si7021 sensor and provides feedback through:
- Visual LCD display showing current status
- Color-coded LED system (green for ideal, yellow for approaching limits, red for out-of-range)
- Audible alerts with different tones for different conditions
- Serial monitoring capability for logging

### Technology used
- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- 16x2 LCD Display
- 3x LEDs (red, yellow, green)
- Adafruit Si7021 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
- Piezo buzzer
- 2x 220Œ© Resistors
- 10kŒ© Potentiometer
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## üìù Usage

1. After uploading the code, the system will immediately begin monitoring humidity
2. The LCD will display current readings and status
3. LEDs and buzzer will provide immediate feedback on humidity conditions:
   - Green LED: Humidity is in ideal range
   - Yellow LED + beep: Humidity is approaching limits
   - Red LED + warning tone: Humidity is outside acceptable range
4. Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to view detailed readings
5. To switch between indoor and terrarium modes, modify the `measureIndoor` variable in the code

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system has predefined humidity ranges for both terrarium and indoor environments:

### Terrarium Mode:
- Ideal range: 65-88% humidity
- Warning range: 60-65% or 88-93% humidity
- Alert range: <60% or >93% humidity

### Indoor Mode:
- Ideal range: 35-55% humidity
- Warning range: 30-35% or 55-60% humidity
- Alert range: <30% or >60% humidity

To adjust these ranges, modify the enum values in the code:

```cpp
// For terrarium environments
enum terrarium {
  TERRARIUM_LOW = 60, 
  TERRARIUM_CLOSE_LOW = 65, 
  TERRARIUM_CLOSE_HIGH = 88, 
  TERRARIUM_HIGH = 93
};

// For indoor environments
enum indoor {
  INDOOR_LOW = 30, 
  INDOOR_CLOSE_LOW = 35, 
  INDOOR_CLOSE_HIGH = 55, 
  INDOOR_HIGH = 60
};
```
