## üß© About

### What problem does this solve?
Maintaining proper humidity levels is critical for both specialized environments like terrariums and everyday living spaces. This project provides a comprehensive solution for:

- **Terrarium environments:** Ensuring optimal conditions for plants and small creatures
- **Indoor spaces:** Preventing mold growth while maintaining comfortable living conditions
- **Remote monitoring:** Checking environmental conditions from anywhere via web dashboard

This smart monitor provides real-time local feedback through LCD, LEDs, and buzzers, while also sending alerts to a cloud dashboard that can be accessed from any web browser.

### How it works
The system creates a complete monitoring loop:

1. **Sensor data collection:** The Si7021 sensor measures humidity and temperature with high precision
2. **Local feedback:** LCD display, LEDs, and buzzer provide immediate status information
3. **WiFi connectivity:** Arduino Uno R4 WiFi connects to your home network
4. **Cloud alerts:** Status updates are sent to a Flask web server hosted on Railway

## üîÑ How It Works

The system operates as a complete monitoring loop:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The Si7021 sensor takes humidity and temperature readings every 5 seconds
   - Sensor performs periodic self-cleaning using the built-in heater function

2. **Local Processing:**
   - Arduino compares readings against the configured thresholds
   - Status is determined (GOOD, WARNING_APPROACHING, or WARNING_BAD)
   - Local feedback is provided through LCD, LEDs, and buzzer

3. **Cloud Communication:**
   - Status updates are sent to the web server when:
     - Status changes from previous reading
     - At regular intervals (every 5 minutes)
     - On initial boot
   - JSON data is transmitted via HTTPS POST requests

4. **Web Interface:**
   - Flask server receives and processes updates
   - Web dashboard displays current status with visual indicators
   - Password protection ensures only authorized users can view data

   - Connect to your WiFi network (watch Serial Monitor for connection status)
   - Begin monitoring humidity and temperature
   
2. The LCD will display current readings and status based on humidity levels

3. LEDs and buzzer provide immediate feedback:
   - Green LED: Humidity is in ideal range
   - Yellow LED + beep: Humidity is approaching limits
   - Red LED + warning tone: Humidity is outside acceptable range
   
4. Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to view detailed readings and connection status

   ```cpp
   bool measureIndoor = true;  // Set to false for terrarium mode
   ```

### Remote Monitoring

1. Access your web dashboard by visiting your Railway app URL
2. Enter the username and password you configured in environment variables
3. View the current humidity status and last update timestamp
4. The dashboard will automatically reflect status changes without needing to refresh

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Arduino Configuration

The system has predefined humidity ranges for both terrarium and indoor environments:

#### Terrarium Mode:
- Ideal range: 65-88% humidity
- Warning range: 60-65% or 88-93% humidity
- Alert range: <60% or >93% humidity

#### Indoor Mode:
- Ideal range: 35-55% humidity
- Warning range: 30-35% or 55-60% humidity
- Alert range: <30% or >60% humidity

To adjust these ranges, modify the enum values in the code:

```cpp
// For terrarium environments
enum terrarium {
  TERRARIUM_LOW = 60, 
  TERRARIUM_CLOSE_LOW = 65, 
  TERRARIUM_CLOSE_HIGH = 88, 
  TERRARIUM_HIGH = 93
};

// For indoor environments
enum indoor {
  INDOOR_LOW = 30, 
  INDOOR_CLOSE_LOW = 35, 
  INDOOR_CLOSE_HIGH = 55, 
  INDOOR_HIGH = 60
};
```

### Web Server Configuration

The Flask server can be configured using environment variables:

- `AUTH_USERNAME`: Username for dashboard access
- `AUTH_PASSWORD`: Password for dashboard access
- `PORT`: (Optional) Port number for the server (defaults to 8080)
